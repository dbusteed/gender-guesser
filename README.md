"messing around with decision trees"

This is an adaption of a decision tree AI learning structure I picked up after watching a YouTube video by Siraj Raval. 

files:

genderGuesser.py - all the script is in here. You'll need scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, and openpyxl on your system to run it. also make sure the xlsx's are in the same directory

genderDataOriginal - basic male/female height and weight data set that i downloaded (forgot where from) and manipulated for easy use. 

genderData.xlsx - this is where the data comes in and goes out
